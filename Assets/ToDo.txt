Take 2 ToDo:
-------------------------------------
()Localization
()Songs need to replay
()Code a recording song feature
()Play custom music?
()Player changes stance on note hit
()can i play the game on guitar yet
()Some sfx/visual fx for missing a note
()Cursor effects or just a script for white outlines on mouseOver
()Some sort of data/stats page to see items/player info
()I want a mouseover textbox for item descriptions
()Refactoring damage numbers to not be 1, probably have each note add up and have clearer terminology on attacks/defends
()I need more feedback, particles? screen shake? pop/shrink animations?
()Expand shop
()Need to add Settings page
()Need to fix arrow sp. effects not playing
()More Items, random chest Items
()Add Comments to code
()Enemy data page, chance rolls on death
()Add in more Items
()Add in more music
()Add in a gacha spinner for rewards
()Add in fire which inflicts notes on attack phase, if notes are missed then dmg is dealt to player
()Add in poison which does the same thing but deals 2x damage if notes in defend stage are missed
()Add in perfect rewards, except there are diff rewards for gettings no misses, no okays+misses, no goods. like +10 gold for no misses but +3 hp for all perfects
()Add in a way to deal with infinite songs/a way to cull notes offscreen
()Add in try/except or error handling on ddol objects giving error
()Add in a screen delay solution?
()Risk of rain esc difficulty with tempo increasing for every step in map taken
()Move stuff from playerprefs into prefs
()Add in enemies/Bosses that increase the tempo/decrease the tempo by themselves >:)
()Add in a space that gives a random effect
()Way in the future add in a star page for all the enemies bronze silver gold if players get no misses all goods only perfs etc...give items or skins based on these?
